&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically when I purchase a new piece of gear I have a particular use case in mind. With my Canon 24-105 F4 L I wanted a great all around lens that could shoot portraits as well as landscapes with relative ease. However, I found that it's excellent at taking macro photos. The true purpose of the trip, from which I snagged all of the wonderful bird photos of the last set, was to investigate some tide pools. My partner loves tide pools, and having grown up in the famously salt water rich state of New Mexico, my tide pooling experience was minimal. In this post I'll talk about this surprising little lens and it's ability to make the smallest places in the world look remarkable.
