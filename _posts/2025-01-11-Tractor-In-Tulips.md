&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm rather proud of this photo; from start to finish everything went almost exactly the way I wanted and the things that didn't were well within the scope of "artistic liberty." In this post I'll walk through where this shot came from, what I was looking to create, and what I did in post-shoot. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an annual tulip festival in a town just outside of Portland, Oregon. This particular farm was in full bloom by the time we got there; each row was a different color than the last and each as vibrant as its neighbor. Among the sprawling tulip fields there sat a handful of tractors. What I found especially great about them was the nearby signs encouraging folks to take pictures with them or sit on them (with a fair amount of CYA legal-ise, mind you). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I really wanted was a shot of this John Deer, with it's once shiny green coat and iconic yellow wheels. This machine is undoubtedly older than me by at least a decade, but I found a certain kinship with it. It looked as though it had a long life of hard work and few days off - likely a similar life to the farmer for whom it was originally purchased. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was shooting with a Canon t6i with an 18-200mm all purpose lens from Tamron (really an exceptional piece of gear), so my framing was spot on. The depth of field could use a little work, but the in-focus field of tulips in front of this mighty machine certainly doesn't detract from the artistic value of the shot. 

Best,
-Ben
