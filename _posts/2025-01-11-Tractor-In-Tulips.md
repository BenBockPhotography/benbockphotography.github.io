&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm rather proud of this photo; from start to finish everything went almost exactly the way I wanted and the things that didn't were well within the scope of "artistic liberty." In this post I'll walk through where this shot came from, what I was looking to create, and what I did in post-shoot. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an annual tulip festival in a town just outside of Portland, Oregon. This particular farm was in full bloom by the time we got there; each row was a different color than the last and each as vibrant as its neighbor. Among the sprawling tulip fields there sat a handful of tractors. What I found especially great about them was the nearby signs encouraging folks to take pictures with them or sit on them (with a fair amount of CYA legal-ise, mind you). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I really wanted was a shot of this John Deer, with it's once shiny green coat and iconic yellow wheels. This machine is undoubtedly older than me by at least a decade, but I found a certain kinship with it. It looked as though it had a long life of hard work and few days off - likely a similar life to the farmer for whom it was originally purchased. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was shooting with a Canon t6i with an 18-200mm all purpose lens from Tamron (really an exceptional piece of gear), so my framing was spot on. The depth of field could use a little work, but the in-focus field of tulips in front of this mighty machine certainly doesn't detract from the artistic value of the shot. I center-framed the the tractor and then took two or three shots. The one that I took into the editing booth was the one that had the least number of people in it as the festival was quite lively. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editing this one was quite easy as the Tamron lens and Canon body produced a lush and vibrant starting image. The only thing that I had trouble with was a small sign advising visitors about parking on a road just beyond the tractor. Typically erasing this sign would take a while and include some masking and high zooms. However, with Lightroom's new "generative erase" tool I was able to simply select the sign and it was removed. It made that one edit a breeze and there is little to no visual queue that the sign was ever there. Mind you and me the Content-Aware remove tool would also do this job, it just takes a bit more finesse. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's how this beautiful image was made! This is the first one in a long time where I felt like I've actually engaged in some kind of artistic endeavor. Something about bright colors and clear subjects tend to make my life a lot easier. Like birds and animals I feel like I was able to easily pick this John Deer out of the tulips and take it home on my SD card. I hope you all enjoyed the read, and I will talk to you more soon.  

Best,
-Ben
