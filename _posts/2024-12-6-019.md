&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one was so hard, I took so many photos and I swear this was the only one that was decently presentable. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hole-lee shutter speed. So this was one of my first outings after receiving my Canon 6D Mk2 from KEH and I was putting the thing through it's paces. Safe to say it did not miss a step (or a wing beat). This shot was taken off of the coast of southern California where a flock of pelicans was foraging near an inlet. I'd personally never seen anything like it and the birds taking off for the deeper waters was a sight to behold. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day the key was framing and nailing shutter speed (along with pelicans not having a crazy fast wind-flap-rate {I know that's not the right phrase, some ornithologist can get in the comments}). I loved being able to track and auto-focus so smoothly and these birds made for some epic scenes; I was able to snag this shot with a somewhat low f-stop and a mid-range iso. Shutter speed was so fast I had to drop iso down a little lower than I would have liked, but that was part of the challenge. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shoot was a blast and I hope I get the chance to observe and document more interesting bird behavior soon. 
Best,
-Ben
