&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've come to a point in my photography endeavor where I want to start finding a style. A while back I took a trip to Fields Bridge Park in Lake Oswego, Oregon to begin the down the long path of defining my own artistic tastes. 


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/FBP_2.jpg) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently I've found myself drawn to more "retro" photos, but that was a bit too broad for my liking. What I was really interested in was these sort of faded, sepia tone flavored photos, but that added a fair amount of pastel color. As with most first attempt, I think this set of photos represents a fair amount of "over doing it." Almost like there is TOO much brown and all other colors are a little too warmed up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to this end I fell like the best next step is to sort of split the difference between a basic edit and this pastel-y, toned down edit. I've got a feeling this process may take a while, but I think that is part of the fun. I have a hard time taking photos just for the sake of taking photos. But if I've a goal then I am suddenly very invested in the work. The nice thing about this fun little feature is that the bar for a "goal" in photography is SO low, like ridiculously low. So it's very easy to break through that bar and just go take some photos. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks again for reading, I am having a great time navigating the nuances of photography and artistic style.
