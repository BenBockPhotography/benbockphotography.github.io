title: Trees in the Distance

Distance is often difficult to capture with a kit lens, especially a kit lens that only goes out to 55mm. Wrapping up my Oregon series, I will talk about what kind of challenges I faced while taking this shot along with what, notably minimal, efforts I took to negate them.

Three things complicated the capturing of this image: first, the smoke, as Oregon was relatively windy that day, and on fire; the distance change of about 1500 yards between closest tree and the hill's peak, and the change in foliage, as what was close had a notably different density than what was far. Light, as always, was a factor, but not an issue with this picture, mostly because everything being captured was at the same relative light level.
The smoke was easy to deal with, I lowered my expectations about how clear the image would be, called a bug a feature, and moved on with life.
The change in foliage also became a feature, but only after I moved myself to a brush free outlook by our vacation cabin.
The challenge came from the distance. Here I was, setup in a good spot, with what seemed to be an exciting shot lined up; but how do I get from here to there? How can I portray the detail of evergreens 15 football fields away while still capturing the nature chaos of the bush-like
