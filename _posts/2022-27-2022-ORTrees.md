title: Trees in the Distance

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ORTrees.jpg)
Distance is often difficult to capture with a kit lens, especially a kit lens that only goes out to 55mm. Wrapping up my Oregon series, I will talk about what kind of challenges I faced while taking this shot along with what, notably minimal, efforts I took to negate them.

Three things complicated the capturing of this image: first, the smoke, as Oregon was relatively windy that day, and on fire; the distance change of about 1500 yards between closest tree and the hill's peak, and the change in foliage, as what was close had a notably different density than what was far.
