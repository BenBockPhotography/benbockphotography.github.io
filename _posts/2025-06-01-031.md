&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy grain batman. After having the bright idea of putting a crop lens on a full frame sensor and running out to the local pond at around 7:30 pm, I was able snag these beauties. Fighting both the post-sunset blue hour amd my cozy f4.some-odd aperture, what popped out of my camera was something that I decided to take directly into Lightroom for touchups.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two images don't have the same look and feel, which with 2020 hindsight, I find myself a bit disappointed. When I set out on this adventure I really wanted to just be out in thw world taking photos for a while, immersing myself in my surroundings and seeing things in a different way. But with a quick battery death and only a handful of shots, this was the best that I could pull off. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly I don't feel like there is a whole lot more to say here. Enjoy the pictures, and I will talk to you all soon!


Best,
-Ben
