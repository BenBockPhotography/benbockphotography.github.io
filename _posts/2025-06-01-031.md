&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy grain batman. After having the bright idea of putting a crop lens on a full frame sensor and running out to the local pond at around 7:30 pm, I was able snag these beauties. Fighting both the post-sunset blue hour amd my cozy f4.some-odd aperture, what popped out of my camera was something that I decided to take directly into Lightroom for touchups.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two images don't have the same look and feel, which with 2020 hindsight, I find myself a bit disappointed. There was an opportunity to keep a cohesive asthenic yet here we have one blue and one orange photo. As such, let's talk about them separately. 




Best,
