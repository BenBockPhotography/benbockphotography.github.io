&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can't live in or around Albuquerque without knowing about the Sandia Mountains; they occupy the entire Eastern horizon, tower above the city, and paint the dying evening sky with a remarkable light. This post will mostly be about my fascination with nature as a subject of the lens, but also a bit about my shooting and editing process and where I could stand to make improvements.
