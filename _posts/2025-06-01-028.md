&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally back to some nature! And some absolutely wonderful birds! I do genuinely enjoy taking photos of birds mostly because they lead such dynamic lives. In this post...well we're just gonna look at some birds! This one is called a Whimbrel!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one is an Osprey! Legitimately some of the most interesting bird of prey behavior I've seen. It appeared as though the bird was just taking a sea bath near the shore. It wasn't really looking for a food, it just seemed to be hanging out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is a seagull. I know they get a bad rep, especially with folks who live near a beach (or any water for that matter), but I tend to be quite fond of their fast-food grabbing antics. 
Best,
