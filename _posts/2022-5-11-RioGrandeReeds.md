One of the more iconic sights of the great state of New Mexico is the Rio Grande River; a once mighty waterway that rips through the middle of the state, giving life to nutrient rich farming valleys and stunning tree lines in the fall. I snapped this picture in early October, just as the leaves were beginning to change. In this post, I'll talk about contrast for a bit.

My Canon m50mk1 has this fun little feature where it's entire screen can swing and pivot on a hinge, which makes it easier to put the lens into difficult spots while still being able to frame a shot. That's what I did here, as I put the camera almost on top of the water in a small boat launch. I remember it being a crisp fall morning as I wanted to take some time to be outside before the harsh winter set in.
