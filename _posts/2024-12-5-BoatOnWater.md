&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This photo was taken off the coast of Northern San Diego, CA. I had a great time with this shoot as the sun rays through the clouds onto the water made for some beautiful moments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi all, there's not a whole lot to say here from the wildlife standpoint, so I figure it would be good to jump into the interesting artistic elements of this photo. In general the clarity of the lens and the resolution of the camera did a lot of the work here. The key was making sure the exposure was spot on; that's the tricky thing about sunsets is that there is such a fine line between completely blown out and so dark the sun itself can't be seen. I think mother nature was doing me some favors here with the cloud cover which made taking this shot just that much more manageable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There wasn't a whole lot to be done in post; it was mostly a matter of sharpening what ended up being some ridiculously soft edges around the boat. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all for reading, as usual I hope to be posting more soon. 
Best,
-Ben
