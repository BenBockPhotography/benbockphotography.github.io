&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This photo was taken off the coast of Northern San Diego, CA. I had a great time with this shoot as the sun rays through the clouds onto the water made for some beautiful moments

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi all, there's not a whole lot to say here from the wildlife standpoint, so I figure it would be good to jump into the interesting artistic elements of this photo. In general the clarity of the lens and the resolution of the camera did a lot of the work here. 
Best,
