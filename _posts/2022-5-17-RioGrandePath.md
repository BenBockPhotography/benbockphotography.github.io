I looked like an absolute goober while taking this picture, but I am pretty happy with what popped out. The lighting was fun to play with on this one, while still being a pain in the backside due to the shadows on the right. Overall, I enjoyed taking this photo as it was a nice time to play with focus and bring out some more dynamic elements of this scene. In this post, I'll talk about what I did in my photo editor and what I would have done better in the field.
