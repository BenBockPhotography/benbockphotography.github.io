I'll continue my Oregon Forest saga with this shot from a small hike we did off the Zig Zag river. While the scenery blew my mind in the moment, what took me aback after the fact was the quality presented in this image.


This image showed me the true power of this tiny camera I had just picked up at BestBuy the week before. When looking back at this picture, I was amazed by the detail shown in the waterfalls near the bottom, the vibrance of the moss covering the fallen logs, and the detail my camera's sensor picked out in the movement of the water. The only camera I had used before this was my parents Nikon 7000 series they had purchased at Costco. It was used for hockey tournaments and family photos, but in the resent years it had always been ac with having too many options and never focusing. The "never focusing" thing may have been my fault as I had set the camera to manual focus mode and then completely forgot to tell my mom I did so.

This camera marked the first camera I had bought for myself, along side a ventage Nikon SLR film camera. While I was suspicious of the relatively high price tag (in reference to my 50 cent cans of noodles; for a camera it was well priced), this photo showed me it was all worth it. I was so amazed by how much realism was captured in the picture. I did very little post processing, mostly because the image did not need it; what came out of the camera was remarkable all on its own. I would soon come to find out that this kind of quality would depend on my shoot good pictures, but a little beginner's luck to instill faith in my equipment went a long way for my interest in photography.

Thank you all for reading, I'll see you in the next post!
