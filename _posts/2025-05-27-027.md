&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a record first I tried just going outside to take some photos in my local neighborhood. I feel like I live in a rather beautiful place, but I found this to be a bit of a challenge. In this post I'll talk about my experience with what feels like naturally beautiful places and how they turn out "on film."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a natural inclination that when I see something that makes me say "oh that looks beautiful" I will be able to take a photo that also makes me feel the same way. In practice, however, this tends not to be the case. First and foremost our eyes operate in notability different ways than the typical DSLR or mirrorless camera. Even if they did, the innate beauty of a scene is not dictated by the colors expressed in its content. 
Best,
