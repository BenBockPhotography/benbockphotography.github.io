title: Small Pond Waterfall

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Portland Rose Gardens had many a breathtaking green space, this sweet little waterfall out of a pond was near the top of the list. Water is a tricky subject to work with because it is both moving and reflective. Motion is one thing, but the sparkling nature of water is another. I hoped to capture the whole scene in this case instead of focusing on a particular aspect. It proved itself challenging, but ultimately I had a good time scrunched up on the ground trying to take a half decent picture. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, technically I did have an option to make this situation a bit easier, I could have used a polarized filter to get rid of some of the shine off the water. These things are tricky to use and definitely a neat piece of gear that I would like to invest a bit more time and brain power on. 

Best,
