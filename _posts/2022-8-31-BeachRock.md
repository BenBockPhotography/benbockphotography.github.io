&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through most of my photos I attempt to recreate exactly what I see with my eye. From the lighting to the focus to the framing, I typically strive to create a photo that is an exact replication of what I see. This photo proved to me that I don't need to recreate the image in my mind to create a beautiful photograph. In this post I'll talk about long exposure photos and how I approach the artistry of photography. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the random technical stuff. I suppose the photography world would call this a "long exposure" photo; I think my shutter speed was set to something like 4 seconds, but I honestly just remember there being double quotes next to the number. What sparked the idea for the long exposure was the waves crashing over this little foot tall rock; it managed to look like an island standing in the sand. What really surprised me is how easy taking the shot was. I changed the exposure time first, setting it as long out as I felt comfortable relative to the f-stop and the iso, and how long I could set my camera on the beach without it getting soaked by a wave, then adjusted the other settings from there. In post, I didn't do a whole lot, mostly adjusted for weird shadows and a bit of under exposure (which was weird, under exposing a long exposure, what?) The final product looks like something I'm proud to post, more artistic than most of my other shots, but still worthy of an honorable mention.
