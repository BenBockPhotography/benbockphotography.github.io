&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's talk about the Redwing Blackbird (*Agelaius phoeniceus*). Residing in the majority of the southern and middle United State while spending summers in southern Canada, this bird's verity of calls make for a staple soundtrack of almost every summer outdoor experience (Sibley, 2016). I was able to snag this perched shot at the Jackson Bottom wetland in Hillsboro, Oregon.  Their iconic calls and nonchalant naming makes them one of my favorite aviators. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a 13 inch wingspan and weighing in at 1.8 oz (Sibley, 2016), these spunky birds can be identified by a red band across the wing, typically accompanied by a smaller yellow band. There is a red only variant, however the tri-colored wing tends to be most prevalent. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been having a great time going out and taking photos of whatever bird may come my way, but I hope in the future to have dedicated research and photography sessions for particular birds. Thanks for reading!

-Best,
Ben
