&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently took a trip to Seattle and I wanted to share some of the photos I was able to snag while we wondered around the city. There is a truly an abundance of unique character surrounding Seattle, and it was a privilege to be able to capture some of it's icons. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Best,
