&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one was so much fun. Walking down a hill during a zoo trip, this little friend was suddenly very interested and me (and perhaps my camera). They ended up about 8 inches away from me, but my lens couldn't focus that close to itself, so this is the best half blurry image I could get. So enjoy this little friend with a funky tail!
