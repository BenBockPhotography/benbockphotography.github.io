&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes an image just happens, and this is a perfect example of this kind of picture. I was on my way down to a La Jolla beach in San Diego to see (and hopefully take pictures of) some seal pups when this sweet squirrel poked their head out of the bush. Thankfully they stayed long enough for me to snag a this photo. In this post I'll talk about focus modes and how they fit into the shooting process. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus modes can provide such a unique tool in both composition and exposure. The first choice is between manual and automatic focusing. After that there are a handful of different focus modes, for this shot I chose the most dynamic setting my camera had to offer (some 27 point uber range blah blah blah, I can't remember, it had a lot of boxes and pulled focus on all of them). Focus modes control how the focus evaluation matrix (situated in a grid or plus shape) assesses the image. Typically there is some flavor of the camera doing everything for you and you doing everything for the camera. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most things, the choice of which focus mode to use comes down to time, effort, and desire. If you have the time and desire to choose a single point in a particular place of the sensor's grid then go for it! If you are running around on vacation through city streets and crowded places then then most dynamic and automatic mode might be the one for you. More often then not I find myself in single point mode selecting the single point dead center of the frame. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I choose that mode (and that point) because I use the "focus and pan" focusing technique. Using this technique the photographer can choose ANY point in the world to pull focus on and then compose the photo around that plane of focus. With the more dynamic modes the photographer needs only compose the shot and let the camera do the work of pulling focus. I used the dynamic mode to take this photo because I didn't think I would have the time to be clever with my focusing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So at the end of the day, the best advice I can give is: know what your photo, or photo shoot, demands and adjust according. If you are shooting in a studio with some crazy low f number, tend towards a one spot auto focus, or go manual focus and do away with the machine all together. If you're out in the wilderness soaked in rain and sweat, the camera can probably give you something to show off at the bar afterwards. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always, thanks for reading, I'll post more soon. 


Best,
