&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bird Blurbs, Killdeer edition! The Killdeer (*Charadrius vociferus*) is a pint sized shorebird found in North and South America (Sibley, 2016). Large relative to its plover siblings, this particular photo was taken at the Tualatin River National Wildlife Preserve, a place witch has become a local favorite of mine since the summer loops have opened up. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plovers are a group of shore birds best defined by their long legs and small stocky bodies. They reside typically on beaches but can be found near any fresh or salt body of water. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foraging and nesting on the ground, the natural colored Killdeer prefers protein rich insects found in its grassland habitat (Jackson & Jackson, 2020). They typically have a successful first broods earlier in the breeding season, with second and third attempts being less fruitful.
