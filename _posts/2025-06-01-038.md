&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bird Blurbs, Killdeer edition! The Killdeer (*Charadrius vociferus*) is a pint sized shorebird found in North and South America (Sibley, 2016). Large relative to its plover siblings, this particular photo was taken at the Tualatin River National Wildlife Preserve, a place witch has become a local favorite of mine since the summer loops have opened up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Nesting) Foraging and nesting on the ground, this natural colored bird prefers protein rich insects found in its grassland habitat.
