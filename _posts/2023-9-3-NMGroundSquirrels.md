&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we moved from the suburbs of Rio Rancho, New Mexico to the slightly less populated suburbs of Rio Rancho, New Mexico these little squirrels have been racing around our property. They are only about four to six inches nose to hind bits (their tail often lays flat on their back), and they love to get into the bird feeders. Today, I will talk about The Harris's Antelope Squirrel (I think).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a BenMayNotKnowWhatHe'sDoing disclaimer: my animal identification skills are not the best, borderline awful, so I ~think~ this is a Harris's Antelope Squirrel, but I cannot say for certain. Everything that I have found about them seems to match and none of the other common types of New Mexico ground squirrel seem to match as well as the Harris's Antelope does. If you feel strongly that this is not a Harris's Antelope squirrel, feel free to leave a comment or send me a message, I welcome any and all feedback!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Harris's Antelope Squirrel is a resident ground squirrel of the American Southwest, occurring in much of Arizona and small areas of New Mexico, California, Nevada, as well as part of northwestern Mexico" says Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum [(Source)](http://greglasley.com/content/Mammals/HarrissAntelopeSquirrel.php). Their small size makes them the perfect desert scavenger as they forage for nuts, wild berries, and wild grains around the desert landscape. Their tail, while not as bushy as a typical tree squirrel, is typically used like a small umbrella along their back [(Source)](https://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/oz/long-fact-sheets/Harris%27s%20Antelope%20ground%20Squirrel.php).
