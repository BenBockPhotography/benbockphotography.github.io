&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So this shot was taken off the cost of Puerto Vallarta during a scouting tri- I'm kidding it's San Diego. This photo felt so nice to take, I love the way I was able to catch the fade from the dying light into blue. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love taking pictures of aircraft, I think there are some neat features to them and they often find themselves in places where they almost feel a bit off. This one was flying up and down the California coast and felt a little out of place in front of this sunset. The thing I couldn't get off my mind though was how wonderful that experience must be for those pilots. The ocean sprawling out below you, the setting sun creating a beautiful ombre of color, and the coastline dappled with city lights.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing I wanted to catch was both the motion of the blades and the feeling of warmth from the sun. The sun had gone down over the horizon fifteen or twenty minutes before this shot making for a great effect that wasn't completely blown out by the strong light of golden hour. What I wasn't expecting is how nice the silhouette of the aircraft would look. Catching enough detail of the landing gear and cockpit without making it feel like it's a documentary of this helicopter. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping to do more photo analysis in my upcoming blog posts even if just to get my thoughts about my photos out of my mind. Thanks for reading!
Best,
-Ben
