title: Duck On A Log

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/014/DuckOnALog.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a family trip to the San Francisco Bay Area we went to a small park with a small pond and on that pond was a small family of ducks. This here is one of those ducks doing some small duck preening.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parks and hiking trails offer a sort of "socially protected" space. That is to say that these spaces are not necessarily lawfully protected, but are protected simply because we either physically can't or choose not to change their state. Keeping these parks and innately protected spaces protected is a key element to ensuring a thriving ecosystem. 

Best,
