title: A Plane in The Sky (Maybe)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shooting the sky is always a fun challenge! This one posed an intersting setup because of the timing of the whole shot. I sat next to my window while working, saw this plane streaking across the sky, reached into my bag to snag my camera and snapped this shot. Everyhthing managed to come together just right for me. Which is odd; most of the time I find myself with 1000 bad pictures for every one good photo I take. This one, however, was one and done. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there! Thanks for clicking the "read more" button, that is super cash-money of you. Not a whole lot else to say on this one, just dumb (or smart) luck. Anywho, I do tend to spend a lot more time writing than I do shooting, so you start to see some smaller blog posts but more of them. It all depends on how I'm feeling, what I'm up to, and what kind of time I have. Hope to be posting loads more soon!

Best,
-Ben
