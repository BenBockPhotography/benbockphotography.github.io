&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This water feature is located at the Portland Rose Gardens in Portland, OR. What stands out to me about this shot is not the photo itself but all of the photos I chose not to take that day. In this post I will talk about when and why of my photos and ultimately what makes it here. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I have started the blog almost all of my photos have been taken using my Canon m50 with it's 50mm lens from KEH.com. I chose this particular camera when shopping because of it's small size, feature rich body, and ease of use. I also bought the Peak Design Capture Camera Clip to hold my small friend. This setup allows me to carry a camera almost everywhere without really noticing it. So when we went to the Portland Rose Garden my m50 came with me, along with five other folks in my partner's family. We generally were just there to take in the Oregon flora
