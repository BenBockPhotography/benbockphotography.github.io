Hi there!
My name is Ben Bock and I am an armature nature Photographer. I am based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, but spend time in California, Oklahoma, and other areas between here and there. I am excited to share a few of the images I've snagged.

### A note about my website
I work in the tech field for my day job, and GitHub Pages was the best solution for making my little minimalistic site. It's a great way to get into website creation and make some space on the internet for yourself. I also want to say thank you to Berry Clark for creating this easy to use framework in Jekyll.
